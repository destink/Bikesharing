## Overview
The purpose of the citi bike rental service in New York City is to determine which performance metrics can be utilized to provide insight in to the implimentation and marketing strategy to bring a bike rental service to Des Moinse, Iowa. 
## Results
### Bike Rides and Customer Type Breakdown
The amount of bike rides in the two week period in august provides us with a idea of demand for a city the size of New York. Followed by the breakdown of customer types. Subscriber or non-subscriber(customer). As you can see approximately 80% of users are "subcribers" which is a good number and a benchmark we can use for the new bike service.

### Checkout Times and Most Heavily Used Starting Locations
The most common trip duration for users is around 5 minutes. The range of most trip durations if from as little as 1 minute up to 30 minutes after that there are still longer rentals but the bulk of demand is for shorter trips which intuitively makes sense given the size of Manhatten. The most heavily used starting locations could provide insight into where to setup bike rental hubs after further analysis determining what these locations have in common. Once we determine the similar characteristics of the starting locations we can use that information to setup bike rental hubs in Des Moines.
