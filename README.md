# Bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of the Citi Bike rental service in New York City is to determine which performance metrics can be utilized to provide insight into the implementation and marketing strategy to bring a bike rental service to Des Moines, Iowa. 
## Results
### Bike Rides and Customer Type Breakdown
The amount of bike rides in the two-week period in august provides us with an idea of demand for a city the size of New York. Followed by the breakdown of customer types. Subscriber or non-subscriber(customer). As you can see approximately 80% of users are "subscribers" which is a good number and a benchmark we can use for the new bike service.

### Checkout Times and Most Heavily Used Starting Locations
The most common trip duration for users is around 5 minutes. The range of most trip durations if from as little as 1 minute up to 30 minutes after that there are still longer rentals, but the bulk of demand is for shorter trips which intuitively makes sense given the size of Manhattan. The most heavily used starting locations could provide insight into where to setup bike rental hubs after further analysis determining what these locations have in common. Once we determine the similar characteristics of the starting locations, we can use that information to setup bike rental hubs in Des Moines.

### Rental Usage Broken Down by Time of Day
From the heat map displayed below you can see that the peak demand is in the early evening from approximately 5-7 pm. The other time frames that have high usage are on the weekday mornings and weekends. During the middle of the day usage drops of significantly as well as during the nighttime hours.

### Breakdown of Trips and Checkout Times by Gender
Utilizing the breakdowns by gender we can see that there is a substantial amount more male user than females. The trip durations are about the same length of time for both sexes. Male Subscribers almost triple the number of trips compared to female subscribers. We can use this information to focus our target marketing campaigns towards females pitching a safe, comfortable, healthy alternative form of commuting. The Trips by Gender heat maps provide insight in to the "unknown" user type in that the usage is primarily on the weekends for non-subscribers. We can use this information as well to try and market subscriptions to Citi Bike by earning rewards or discounts, bike reservations and overall convenience.

## Summary 
There are absolutely insights to be taken from this data and visualizations to attempt to scale the Citi Bike rental service towards a smaller city like Des Moines. However, I am skeptical that we can guarantee that the demand will be comparable given that the population of Manhattan alone is 800 times that of Des Moines and the population density of Des Moines [Des Moines Population] (https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/des-moines-ia-population) is less than 10% of New York City [NYC Population] (https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population). There is also not data regarding costs of bicycles, bike hubs, maintenance or any of the initial investment costs or overhead expenses. The same can be said for any revenue and profit metrics which would be extremely helpful when deciding if a bike rental program would make sense for a city like Des Moines.
